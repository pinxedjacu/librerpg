# librerpgs
A project aiming to promote true open and free roleplay gaming. #LibreRPGs

## Purpose

The LibreRPG project is a response to the strife caused by the leaked changes in the upcoming Open Game License 1.1 (OGL 1.1), the impact it is having on D&D, as well as the RPG community as a whole. It is also a response to the calls for an "#OpenDnD", which we believe to be an inadequate solution to the problem. #LibreRPG seeks to promote a base standard as to what constitutes an open or free rpg, and promote games that follow these standards.

We want to help anyone who's interested to be able to make choices that will prevent them from future abuses by corporate interests, and preserve real open gaming as a whole.

## The Problem

Years ago Wizards of the Coast published a license agreement known as the Open Game License (OGL), which today we're calling either OGL 1.0 or OGL 1.0a. This license made it so that a subset of the D&D materials were mostly freely available for anyone to make use of. These free materials could be found in their System Reference Document (SRD). It was not only a matter of these materials being free of monetary charge. More broadly this SRD had become a kind of commons, a resource that anyone could make use of, make copies of, make modified versions of, and even base entire careers around.

But recently a leak occurred, which details a sweeping set of changes to the OGL license, this new version being known as OGL 1.1. The tl;dr version is that this new license would make OGL quite the opposite of a commons, and threatens the livelihoods of many content creators. This [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/dnd-wizards-of-the-coast-ogl-1-1-open-gaming-license-1849950634) article details those changes. What Wizards of the Coast plans to do cannot be considered open gaming by any stretch of the imagination.

## Why #OpenDnD is not Enough

Some people have rallied together under the hashtag of #OpenDnD. You can see what they're about [here](https://www.opendnd.games/). Essentially they are calling for WotC to let go of OGL 1.1, and return to a good faith relationship they've had with their customers for more than twenty years, with ogl 1.0a as it already is. This response has good intentions, but it doesn't go far enough to ensure an enduring solution. Here's why-

* This is not the first time WotC has acted in bad faith toward the DnD community. With 4e they switched to a more restrictive license. Were it not for the massive backlash against 4e and players moving to other games like Pathfinder and the older D&D 3.5, WotC likely would not have returned to the OGL in 5e.

* #OpenDnD seeks to return to this status quo, without fixing the underlying problems, which is the ogl license itself, and that WotC has shown they will keep trying one scheme after another to move to a more restrictive model. From their website: "#OpenDnD is a rallying cry under which creators and fans have unified to demand that WotC revoke the draconian 1.1 OGL and pledge to support the existing 1.0 OGL into future editions of their games. This isnâ€™t an opportunity to litigate and tinker with a new license, but to return to the values of open gaming."

* What other flaws might the existing OGL license have?

The problem is that there is at least one key flaw in the current OGL 1.0a that appears to allow WotC to retroactively *deauthorize* every game published using that license. Namely the license lacks an explicit statement on *irrevocability*. This means that even if WotC dropped OGL 1.1 now, they would still have the power make more restrictions in the future. Returning to the status quo is not a solution to this problem.

## LibeRPGs Initiative

What #LibreRPG proposes, and will build toward is:

1. Providing info for licenses that will be more robust in protecting open and free gaming - this matter is open to discusion but as an initial baseline, such licenses should be ones authored and actively maintained by legal experts, and be ones that are from nonprofit organizations whose very goal *is the preservation of free and open resources*.

2. Curating a list of ttrpgs for anyone to use that we think truly respects the rights of players, and content creators.

3. Being a general community around which people can organize and grow.

This document is only a rough draft first step. If this project aligns with your values, please get involved. Comment, contribute, propose additions and changes, *make rpgs*.
