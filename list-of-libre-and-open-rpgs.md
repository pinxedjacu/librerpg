# A list of Libre and Open RPGs

This page will list existing RPGs and related systems that meet our criteria of freedom and openness. Like the [Licenses](https://github.com/pinxedjacu/librerpg/blob/main/list-of-good-rpg-licenses.md) page, this one will have separate lists for rpgs that are open or lax, and those that are strictly copyleft. Open rpgs are those published under the CC BY license, and copyleft are those published under the CC BY-SA license.

If you know of a compatible rpg that's not already on this list, *please let us know!*

## Open RPGs

### Games Using CC BY License

* [2400](https://jasontocci.itch.io/2400) and their [SRD](https://jasontocci.itch.io/24xx).
* [AdventureLand](http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/adventureland).
* [Aleph RPG](https://www.facebook.com/AlephRPG/) - and [non-facebook](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/282761/Aleph-RPG--v-20) link.
* [Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut](http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2012/12/baba-yagas-dancing-hut/).

* [Cyberrats](https://alrine.itch.io/cyberrats) CC BY licensed, but it's based on [LUMEN](https://gilarpgs.itch.io/lumen), which I have not been able to find a definitive license for. It deserves a closer look because *a lot* of games are based on it.
* [D10/0](https://www.bestwithstuff.com/RPGProjects.html) - rules system and some games based around it.
* [D6 Pool Modern](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134520/D6Pool-Modern-Roleplaying?src=newest), "Prep Fast, Play Fast."

Evil Hat's approach should really be seen as the reference model that others should strive for.
