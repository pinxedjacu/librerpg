# A list of Libre and Open RPGs

This page will list existing RPGs and related systems that meet our criteria of freedom and openness. Like the [Licenses](https://github.com/pinxedjacu/librerpg/blob/main/list-of-good-rpg-licenses.md) page, this one will have separate lists for rpgs that are open or lax, and those that are strictly copyleft. Open rpgs are those published under the CC BY license, and copyleft are those published under the CC BY-SA license.

If you know of a compatible rpg that's not already on this list, *please let us know!*

## Open RPGs

### Games Using CC BY License

* [2400](https://jasontocci.itch.io/2400) and their [SRD](https://jasontocci.itch.io/24xx).
* [Aleph RPG](https://www.facebook.com/AlephRPG/) - and [non-facebook](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/282761/Aleph-RPG--v-20) link.
* [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/) - their [SRD](https://bladesinthedark.com/node/33).
* [C22](https://c22system.com/thebasics) - playing card based srd.
* [CAPERS](https://www.nerdburgergames.com/capers).
* [Carta](https://peachgardengames.itch.io/carta-srd) - solo rpg.
* [Commonsense](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/359829/Commonsense-A-RolePlaying-Game-System).
* [CORE Micro SRD](https://as-if.itch.io/core-micro).
* [Cyberrats](https://alrine.itch.io/cyberrats) CC BY licensed, but it's based on [LUMEN](https://gilarpgs.itch.io/lumen), which I have not been able to find a definitive license for. It deserves a closer look because *a lot* of games are based on it.
* [D10/0](https://www.bestwithstuff.com/RPGProjects.html) - rules system and some games based around it.
* [D6 Pool Modern](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134520/D6Pool-Modern-Roleplaying?src=newest), "Prep Fast, Play Fast."
* [Fari RPGs](https://fari.games/browse/fari-rpgs) - Multiple resources and rules systems, all CC BY licensed.
* [FATE](https://evilhat.com/product/fate-core-system/) is a great example on this list. Their [open materials](https://www.faterpg.com/licensing/licensing-fate-cc-by/) are easy to find, clear in their licensing, and they have *a lot* of free stuff to work with. Evil Hat's approach should really be seen as the reference model that others should strive for.
* [FATE Polyhedral](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5hl8z4kjvbhrbxf/Fate%20Polyhedral%20Edition.pdf?dl=0), a modified version of FATE that uses polyhedral dice.
* [Five by Five](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/115748/Five-by-Five?manufacturers_id=5581).
* [Forge Engine](https://www.heroforgegames.com/forge-engine/).

* [Gratitude](https://alrine.itch.io/gratitude-a-horror-game) - a horror game. Creator kit is [here](https://alrine.itch.io/gratitude-creators-kit).
* [GUMSHOE SRD](https://pelgranepress.com/2013/10/24/the-gumshoe-system-reference-document/).

* [Zireael07's list](https://github.com/Zireael07/awesome-tabletop-rpgs) - The initial bulk of games populating this list comes from Zireael07's Awesome ttrpg list. If you don't care about what licenses the games are under, it's an Awesome list to check out.
* [E Chris Garrison's list](https://sillyhatbooks.com/other-stuff/games/) - unfortunately the majority of links were broken here, but I did find a few games to add, so I'm including it.
