# A list of Libre and Open RPGs

This page will list existing RPGs and related systems that meet our criteria of freedom and openness. Like the [Licenses](https://github.com/pinxedjacu/librerpg/blob/main/list-of-good-rpg-licenses.md) page, this one will have separate lists for rpgs that are open or lax, and those that are strictly copyleft. Open rpgs are those published under the CC BY license, and copyleft are those published under the CC BY-SA license.

If you know of a compatible rpg that's not already on this list, *please let us know!*
