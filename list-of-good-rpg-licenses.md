# A List of Good RPG Licenses

This page will document a list of licenses that we think are a good fit for an RPG author who wants to respect and support free/libre and open gaming. Please note **this is not legal advice, and we are not lawyers.**

## Defining Free, Libre, and Open Gaming

To know what we're even talking about, a little history matters. These all have their roots in two movements: The [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/) movement, and the [Open-Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/). They're similar, but not the same. These two movements inspired others, such as the [Free Culture](https://lessig.org/product/free-culture/) movement which led to the creation of the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) project. Likewise the [Open Gaming Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_gaming), which is specific to tabletop gaming, grew out of the same millieu.

It's a good idea to learn more about all of those movements - they've all played important roles in shaping our lives today. But to keep this simple, the main takeaway is that there's a bit of a split between movements calling themselves "open", and those calling themselves "free" and/or "libre." We'll define our terms with these differences in mind, and maintain two separate lists - open licenses, and free/libre licenses. 

### Free and Libre

To get it out of the way right now, libre *is* free. These two words are entirely interchangeable, think libre as in liberty. People sometimes prefer libre because it makes it more clear that we're talking specifically about *freedom*, not merely free of cost (gratis). These libre movements assert that regarding software and media in general, we should have the rights to use(for any purpose), study, make copies, make modifications, share, distribute, and even sell a given creative work. People who advocate for this libre way of life generally believe that there is no valid space for proprietary licenses anywhere. For this reason they will tend to prefer more strict licenses that grant all of the aforementioned freedoms, but which require all derivatives to be published with compatible licenses only. Collectively we call these licenses **Copyleft** licenses, because what they do is take copyright law and essentially turn it against itself.

If you think that restrictive copyrights and licensing *cannot* coexist with these values of freedom, copyleft may be for you.

### Open

Open movements are similar to libre ones - they generally want software and media to have all those same freedoms, but they permit circumstances where more restrictive copyright models may exist. Because of this, they'll often use licenses that are *even more permissive* than copyleft ones, allowing all of those same freedoms, but also allowing anyone to sell derivatives *that take those freedoms away.*

## Licenses

The licenses you choose for your own project depend on whether you're making software, or some other form of media; and whether you think copyleft models or more permissive models are right for you. If you're serious about your work, please also consider consulting with a lawyer before you commit to anything.

We believe that a good license is one that is actively maintained by real legal experts who work in the specialty of intellectual property law, and are ones that come from nonprofit organizations whose very goals are to ensure the preservation of freedom and openness that we listed previously (use, study, copy, modify, distribute, sell).

### Open Licenses.

* **Most Media:** [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (CC BY 4.0). As an rpg creator, this is likely the choice you want for your license. If you're looking to do things similar to other publishers, you can release your SRD with this license, and then publish your core rulebook and all other materials under whichever licenses you think are best for you.

* **Software:** [Apache 2.0 license](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Apache-2.0). A software license. This choice is a bit of a challenge. There are a lot of "lax" licenses out there. We went with this one because it's recommended by the [FSF](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#apache2).

### Libre Licenses

* **Most Media:** Creative Commons [Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (CC BY-SA 4.0). CC BY-SA is a copyleft license, like the GPL. It's good for anything *other* than software - potentially rulebooks and System Reference Documents, for example. Creative Commons has a great history of protecting our information rights by ensuring that we have a robust media commons that we can all benefit from. It's another well-established license.

* **Software:** [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) (GPL). This is a copyleft license specifically written for software, though you can use it for things other than software as long as you clearly define what "source code" is. If you're making software and you want to make sure that both your version, *and* any modified versions will always be free, this is the license to use. The Free Software Foundation are the original protectors of software freedom. They've been doing it for a long time, and the GPL is well-tested. 

## Why Not Other Licenses?

This page is a currently a rough draft, and very much subject to change. More dialogue needs to happen, particularly from parties who are most informed on this subject matter. For now this list is being kept small, and we will try to be careful about additions, as well as establishing more detailed and precise criteria to base the list on. For instance, we know now that any worthwhile license *must* explicitly state that it's *irrevocable* if we want to avoid another OGL mess in the future.

## What about product identity?

Some people have expressed concerns or even an outright rejection of licenses like Creative Commons, because they want a license that's more like the OGL in defining a separate "product identity" that the author can keep under more restrictive terms. This project does not have a definitive position on this yet, so we're open to feedback. 

For now it's the present author's opinion that maybe it's better not to use a license like that. I think that if you are writing an rpg and you want some stuff to be free, and other things not free: it's more helpful for your players to have everything that is free in one document, and then everything else in whatever you want to publish it in. It's preferable to be able to know unambiguously that *everything* in an SRD really is free, as opposed to additional stipulations that might complicate matters.

## What About a New License?

If that's what anyone wants to do, go for it. Understand though that there is an existing history of problems associated with new licenses, as well as proliferation of too many licenses. What the current OGL situation shows us is that we should be using tools that are well-tested, written by people who specialize in this, and whose *primary goal* is the protection and preservation of freedom and openness. If an expert in intellectual property law published a new kind of Open Game License Two Point Zero tomorrow, it might have promise, but as a precaution this project would still want to give that license time to be put to the test and see how it works out before recommending it.
