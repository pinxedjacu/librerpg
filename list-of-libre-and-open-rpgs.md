# A list of Libre and Open RPGs

This page will list existing RPGs and related systems that meet our criteria of freedom and openness. Like the [Licenses](https://github.com/pinxedjacu/librerpg/blob/main/list-of-good-rpg-licenses.md) page, this one will have separate lists for rpgs that are open or lax, and those that are strictly copyleft. Open rpgs are those published under the CC BY license, and copyleft are those published under the CC BY-SA license.

If you know of a compatible rpg that's not already on this list, *please let us know!*

## Open RPGs

### Games Using CC BY License

* [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/) - their [SRD](https://bladesinthedark.com/node/33) is CC BY.
* [Castles & Crusades](https://www.trolllord.com/tlgstore/#!/Castles-&-Crusades-Players-Handbook-7th-Printing-Digital-Standard-Cover/p/89198194/category=11639170) - *maybe.* Their licensing setup is a little confusing. They seem to have materials (mainly the Player Handbook) available under multiple licenses. The one printed in the back of the Player Handbook is OGL 1.0a, but on their [website](https://trolllord.com/3rd-party-publishing/) they have CC BY too.
* [FATE](https://evilhat.com/product/fate-core-system/) is a great example on this list. Their [open materials](https://www.faterpg.com/licensing/licensing-fate-cc-by/) are easy to find, clear in their licensing, and they have *a lot* of free stuff to work with. Evil Hat's approach should really be seen as the reference model that others should strive for.
